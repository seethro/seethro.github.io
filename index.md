MyMediaSilo is a self-hosted cloud service that is based on [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/). Unlike Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive or Amazon, MyMediaSilo is hosted on a private server, and doesnt suffer any privacy issues. 

### What can you do with MyMediaSilo?
- Securely backup photos and video from your smartphone
- View files via secure website and smartphone

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/seethro/seethro.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes
